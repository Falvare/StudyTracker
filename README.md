# StudyTracker 

This is a command line study timer that will keep a log of your study sessions and give you an overview after each session. 

Each study session is 30 minutes long with a 5 minute break after. This program will notify you after your 30 minute study session is over and prompt you to take a break. 
It will notify you once your break is over asking if you would like to continue. If you would like to begin another 30 minute study session after your break input 'yes', otherwise input 'no'. 

Once you are finished studying, it will search for a text file with the name of subject you entered into the program. If there is no file by that name, it will create a new 
file and log the date, number of sessions completed, and the total hours completed. If there is already a file by that name, it will add add that information to the existing file.

Once the session information is written to the file, the program will then read through the file and give you the number of blocks and hours that you did this session as well as the 
overall sessions and hours for that subject.
